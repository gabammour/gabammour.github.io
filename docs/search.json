    "text": "Heron‚Äôs formula is a formula for finding the area of a triangle when you know the lengths of its three sides. It is named after the ancient Greek mathematician, Hero of Alexandria, who first described it.\n\\[A = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\\]\nwhere \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the lengths of the sides of the triangle, \\(s\\) is the semiperimeter of the triangle, which is defined as \\(s = \\frac{1}{2}(a + b + c)\\), and \\(A\\) is the area of the triangle. The reason Heron‚Äôs formula works is that it is based on the concept of the ‚ÄúHeronian triangle,‚Äùwhich is a triangle with integer sides and integer area. Heron‚Äôs formula gives the exact area of a Heronian triangle, and it turns out that every triangle can be split into two Heronian triangles. So, by using Heron‚Äôs formula to find the area of each of these two triangles and adding the results, you get the area of the original triangle.\n\n\nThe package must be install through my personal GitHub account.

    "text": "The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (EPU)1\nThe EPU index was first introduced by Scott R. Baker, Nick Bloom, and Stephen J. Davis in a seminal paper published in 2012. The index is based on the frequency of newspaper articles that mention policy-related economic uncertainty. The authors argue that this measurement is an accurate proxy for economic policy uncertainty, as media coverage of policy-related uncertainty reflects the opinions and views of experts, market participants, and the general public.\n\n\nPlotting of the EPU Index\nThe R code provided in this article uses the ggplot2 library to visualize the EPU index over time. The code starts by defining the data source (base) and creating a plot object with the x-axis representing the date and the y-axis representing the EPU index. The plot is then decorated with various elements to enhance its readability and aesthetic appeal.\nThe scale_x_date function is used to set the date format and to break the x-axis into intervals of 5 years. The scale_y_continuous function sets the limits of the y-axis to a range of 0 to 320. The theme_light function sets the plot‚Äôs overall theme to a light color palette, while the theme function sets the color, size, and type of the axis lines.\nThe annotate function is used to add text annotations to the plot, highlighting important economic events such as the subprime crisis, the 9/11 attacks, and the Covid-19 pandemic. The geom_segment function is used to add arrows to the plot, showing the direction and magnitude of the changes in the EPU index. The theme function is then used to set the legend position, justification, direction, and to add a caption to the plot.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe R code provided in this article is a simple yet effective way of visualizing the EPU index and its relationship with significant economic events. The plot highlights the impact of various events on the uncertainty index, making it a useful tool for economists, policymakers, and market participants to gain insights into the economic policy environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nplot_EPU <- ggplot(base, aes(x = Date)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = EPU, color = \"EPU\")) +\n  scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%Y\", date_breaks = \"5 years\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,320)) +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = \"black\",size = 0.2, linetype = \"solid\")) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = as.Date(\"2020-03-01\", format = \"%Y-%m-%d\"), y = 320, label = \"Covid-19\", color = \"black\", angle=0,  size = 2) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = as.Date(\"2006-12-01\", format = \"%Y-%m-%d\"), y = 190, label = \"Subprime\", color = \"black\", angle=0, size = 2) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = as.Date(\"1986-10-19\", format = \"%Y-%m-%d\"), y = 185, label = \"Black Monday\", color = \"black\", angle=0, size = 2) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = as.Date(\"2001-09-11\", format = \"%Y-%m-%d\"), y = 200, label = \"9/11\", color = \"black\", angle=0, size = 2) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = as.Date(\"2011-03-01\", format = \"%Y-%m-%d\"), y = 260, label = \"Euro debt crisis\", color = \"black\", angle=0, size = 2) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = as.Date(\"1990-10-01\", format = \"%Y-%m-%d\"), y = 185, label = \"Gulf war I\", color = \"black\", angle=0, size = 2) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = as.Date(\"2007-01-01\", format = \"%Y-%m-%d\"), y = 180, xend = as.Date(\"2008-01-01\", format = \"%Y-%m-%d\") , yend=150), arrow = arrow(length = unit(.12, \"cm\"),type = \"closed\")) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = as.Date(\"1987-01-19\", format = \"%Y-%m-%d\"), y = 180, xend = as.Date(\"1987-10-19\", format = \"%Y-%m-%d\"), yend = 165), arrow = arrow(length = unit(.12, \"cm\"),type = \"closed\")) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\", \n        legend.justification = \"left\",\n        legend.direction = \"horizontal\") +\n  xlab(\"Date\") + ylab(\"Economic policy Uncertainty Index\") +\n  labs(caption = \"Source: Baker, Scott R., Bloom, Nick and Davis, Stephen J., Economic Policy Uncertainty Index for United States\", color = \"Legend : \") +\n  theme(text = element_text(family = \"Helvetica\"))\n\nplot_EPU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nMeasuring Economic Policy Uncertainty.‚Ü©Ô∏é"

    "title": "Studying meat consumption among college students",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Methods\nTo achieve this, we conducted an online survey to evaluate the students‚Äô positions on these three causes. The results of the survey allowed us to segment the population into four types of consumers: inactive, occasional, regular, and dependent. Using multiple component analysis and clustering techniques, we were then able to determine three distinct clusters: the committed, the aware, and the skeptical. We used the ordinary least squares method to quantify and measure the magnitude of these relationships, though we caution that our results may be affected by an endogeneity problem. Despite these limitations, our findings suggest that food and health behaviors, as well as environmental concerns, have a significant impact on meat consumption among students at the University of Nantes.\n\n\nResults\nOur findings indicated that the majority of the student population was aware of the negative impacts of the meat industry on the environment, health, and animal welfare. However, we observed a clear relationship between the students‚Äô cluster membership and their meat consumption patterns. Students who were skeptical about environmental, health, and animal considerations tended to be regular or dependent meat consumers, while those who were committed to food and health behaviors and environmental concerns consumed on average almost half as much meat as the aware students.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, our report highlights the need for public policies to be more specific in addressing the hazards of meat consumption, particularly processed meat, on the health of all citizens. Given that the student population seems to be relatively well-informed about animal and environmental issues, there may be an opportunity to better educate them about the health effects of meat consumption and encourage more sustainable dietary habits. As the world faces the challenges of a rapidly growing population and limited resources, reducing our dependence on meat will likely be necessary for a sustainable and healthy future.\nFull text pdf here"

    "section": "Value proposition",
    "text": "Value proposition\nGitHub‚Äôs value proposition is based on four primary pillars. The foremost and most critical of these pillars is collaboration. Through the use of powerful tools such as repositories, GitHub provides an environment in which multiple developers can work simultaneously on the same codebase. Simply put, a repository is a virtual space where individuals can store and manage their code, similar to a folder on a local computer. However, in this case, the repository is located on GitHub servers, which are hosted in the cloud. If a repository is public, any user can access and modify its contents, fostering a sense of collaboration and teamwork.\nThe second pillar of GitHub is version control. The platform‚Äôs version control system, Git, enables developers to track changes to code over time, facilitating the identification and correction of bugs and errors.\nThe third pillar is the community. GitHub boasts a vast and active community of developers who contribute to open-source projects, share code, and provide support to one another. This sense of community is a crucial aspect of GitHub‚Äôs value proposition, as it promotes knowledge-sharing and facilitates the exchange of ideas.\nFinally, the fourth pillar of GitHub is integration. The platform can be seamlessly integrated with a broad range of third-party tools and services, creating a central hub for managing the entire software development workflow. This feature streamlines the development process, making it more efficient and effective."

    "text": "Revenue model\nAs with many pure players, GitHub provides both free and paid services, operating on a freemium model. This approach is a common business strategy employed by software companies and social media platforms, as it enables them to garner a large user base before monetizing their offerings. Specifically, GitHub‚Äôs platform offers a complimentary version that permits users to create an unlimited number of public repositories and collaborate with other developers on open-source projects. However, this free service is subject to limitations in storage capacity.\nThe second offering, the GitHub Pro version, works as an extension of the free iteration, increasing the user experience by expanding storage capacity and introducing features such as GitHub Support via email, GitHub Pages, and Protected branches. Although the initial two products are oriented towards single users, GitHub also provides the same two versions for teams and organizations. The team version is analogous to the pro version, but it enables teams to access private repositories and expand their membership. Meanwhile, the organization version mirrors the free version but caters to organizations. We may also mention that GitHub offers a student developer pack that provides free access to GitHub Pro for students.\nLastly, GitHub‚Äôs ultimate offering, GitHub Enterprise, is the most expensive and primarily targets large companies. It comes with a host of features, such as SAML single sign-on, advanced security measures, and GitHub Enterprise Support.\nFurthermore, GitHub provides several paid services, including GitHub Actions, GitHub Packages, and GitHub Marketplace. GitHub Actions empowers developers to automate their software development workflows, streamlining the process and saving time. Meanwhile, GitHub Packages is a service that enables developers to store and share code packages with other developers, enhancing collaboration and productivity. Finally, GitHub Marketplace offers a platform that enables developers to explore and install third-party tools and services that integrate with GitHub, broadening the scope and functionality of the platform. The last example of these additional services is GitHub Copilot, an AI pair programmer that helps developers write code faster by providing autocomplete suggestions."
