    "text": "Heron‚Äôs formula is a formula for finding the area of a triangle when you know the lengths of its three sides. It is named after the ancient Greek mathematician, Hero of Alexandria, who first described it.\n\\[A = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\\]\nwhere \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the lengths of the sides of the triangle, \\(s\\) is the semiperimeter of the triangle, which is defined as \\(s = \\frac{1}{2}(a + b + c)\\), and \\(A\\) is the area of the triangle. The reason Heron‚Äôs formula works is that it is based on the concept of the ‚ÄúHeronian triangle,‚Äùwhich is a triangle with integer sides and integer area. Heron‚Äôs formula gives the exact area of a Heronian triangle, and it turns out that every triangle can be split into two Heronian triangles. So, by using Heron‚Äôs formula to find the area of each of these two triangles and adding the results, you get the area of the original triangle.\n\n\nThe package must be install through my personal GitHub account.

    "text": "The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (EPU)1\nThe EPU index was first introduced by Scott R. Baker, Nick Bloom, and Stephen J. Davis in a seminal paper published in 2012. The index is based on the frequency of newspaper articles that mention policy-related economic uncertainty. The authors argue that this measurement is an accurate proxy for economic policy uncertainty, as media coverage of policy-related uncertainty reflects the opinions and views of experts, market participants, and the general public.\n\n\nPlotting of the EPU Index\nThe R code provided in this article uses the ggplot2 library to visualize the EPU index over time. The code starts by defining the data source (base) and creating a plot object with the x-axis representing the date and the y-axis representing the EPU index. The plot is then decorated with various elements to enhance its readability and aesthetic appeal.\nThe scale_x_date function is used to set the date format and to break the x-axis into intervals of 5 years. The scale_y_continuous function sets the limits of the y-axis to a range of 0 to 320. The theme_light function sets the plot‚Äôs overall theme to a light color palette, while the theme function sets the color, size, and type of the axis lines.\nThe annotate function is used to add text annotations to the plot, highlighting important economic events such as the subprime crisis, the 9/11 attacks, and the Covid-19 pandemic. The geom_segment function is used to add arrows to the plot, showing the direction and magnitude of the changes in the EPU index. The theme function is then used to set the legend position, justification, direction, and to add a caption to the plot.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe R code provided in this article is a simple yet effective way of visualizing the EPU index and its relationship with significant economic events. The plot highlights the impact of various events on the uncertainty index, making it a useful tool for economists, policymakers, and market participants to gain insights into the economic policy environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nplot_EPU <- ggplot(base, aes(x = Date)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = EPU, color = \"EPU\")) +\n  scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%Y\", date_breaks = \"5 years\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,320)) +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = \"black\",size = 0.2, linetype = \"solid\")) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = as.Date(\"2020-03-01\", format = \"%Y-%m-%d\"), y = 320, label = \"Covid-19\", color = \"black\", angle=0,  size = 2) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = as.Date(\"2006-12-01\", format = \"%Y-%m-%d\"), y = 190, label = \"Subprime\", color = \"black\", angle=0, size = 2) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = as.Date(\"1986-10-19\", format = \"%Y-%m-%d\"), y = 185, label = \"Black Monday\", color = \"black\", angle=0, size = 2) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = as.Date(\"2001-09-11\", format = \"%Y-%m-%d\"), y = 200, label = \"9/11\", color = \"black\", angle=0, size = 2) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = as.Date(\"2011-03-01\", format = \"%Y-%m-%d\"), y = 260, label = \"Euro debt crisis\", color = \"black\", angle=0, size = 2) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = as.Date(\"1990-10-01\", format = \"%Y-%m-%d\"), y = 185, label = \"Gulf war I\", color = \"black\", angle=0, size = 2) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = as.Date(\"2007-01-01\", format = \"%Y-%m-%d\"), y = 180, xend = as.Date(\"2008-01-01\", format = \"%Y-%m-%d\") , yend=150), arrow = arrow(length = unit(.12, \"cm\"),type = \"closed\")) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = as.Date(\"1987-01-19\", format = \"%Y-%m-%d\"), y = 180, xend = as.Date(\"1987-10-19\", format = \"%Y-%m-%d\"), yend = 165), arrow = arrow(length = unit(.12, \"cm\"),type = \"closed\")) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\", \n        legend.justification = \"left\",\n        legend.direction = \"horizontal\") +\n  xlab(\"Date\") + ylab(\"Economic policy Uncertainty Index\") +\n  labs(caption = \"Source: Baker, Scott R., Bloom, Nick and Davis, Stephen J., Economic Policy Uncertainty Index for United States\", color = \"Legend : \") +\n  theme(text = element_text(family = \"Helvetica\"))\n\nplot_EPU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nMeasuring Economic Policy Uncertainty.‚Ü©Ô∏é"

    "title": "Studying meat consumption among college students",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Methods\nTo achieve this, we conducted an online survey to evaluate the students‚Äô positions on these three causes. The results of the survey allowed us to segment the population into four types of consumers: inactive, occasional, regular, and dependent. Using multiple component analysis and clustering techniques, we were then able to determine three distinct clusters: the committed, the aware, and the skeptical. We used the ordinary least squares method to quantify and measure the magnitude of these relationships, though we caution that our results may be affected by an endogeneity problem. Despite these limitations, our findings suggest that food and health behaviors, as well as environmental concerns, have a significant impact on meat consumption among students at the University of Nantes.\n\n\nResults\nOur findings indicated that the majority of the student population was aware of the negative impacts of the meat industry on the environment, health, and animal welfare. However, we observed a clear relationship between the students‚Äô cluster membership and their meat consumption patterns. Students who were skeptical about environmental, health, and animal considerations tended to be regular or dependent meat consumers, while those who were committed to food and health behaviors and environmental concerns consumed on average almost half as much meat as the aware students.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, our report highlights the need for public policies to be more specific in addressing the hazards of meat consumption, particularly processed meat, on the health of all citizens. Given that the student population seems to be relatively well-informed about animal and environmental issues, there may be an opportunity to better educate them about the health effects of meat consumption and encourage more sustainable dietary habits. As the world faces the challenges of a rapidly growing population and limited resources, reducing our dependence on meat will likely be necessary for a sustainable and healthy future."
